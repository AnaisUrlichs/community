### Criteria 
The following are the kind of contributions we would like to encourage and which will be likely to get nominated. 

    Code contributions to one of the participating projects, in the form of a pull request. 

    Participating in discussions in the community, for example answering other members‚Äô questions, providing feedback on proposed initiatives, etc. 

    Content creation about the participating projects, creating tutorials and useful education materials. This can be either written or recorded. 

    Advocating for participating projects. For example, speaking at events, recommending, resharing content, or any similar activities that helps spread the word about the projects. 

#### **Participating Projects** 

Not everything under Aqua Security‚Äôs GitHub organization is eligible for this program, nor welcome external contributors. The following are the projects which participate in the program and which we encourage and solicit contribution for. Note that these are the names of the projects, and not the names of git repositories which are naturally included as well (a single project might consist of multiple different repositories). 

- Trivy 
- Tfsec 
- Tracee 
- Btf-hub 
- Libbpfgo 
- Kube-bench 

### Process üì•

    Open source projects maintainers nominate candidates based on ongoing interactions and contributions observed in the community.  

    Monthly meeting takes place to review candidates, evaluate their contribution and pick one contributor of the month. 

    Bi-Annual meeting takes place to review past contributors of the month, evaluate their contribution and pick one super contributor. 

    At this stage, the selection process in its entirety will be kept internal, including nominations, selection meetings, and justification. 

    Winners will be contacted via the contribution medium and will be asked to engage with the team via email or slack for facilitating the selection. 

    For a code contribution in GitHub, a comment on the pull request tagging the author. 

    For a content contribution, it will most likely be added to the project documentation‚Äôs tutorials section, in which case a comment will be made on the pull request as well. 

    For content creation which was not added to documentation, a reasonable attempt to contact the author will be made within the platform where the content was published. For example, a YouTube comment, a blog post comment, an email to the email that appears on file, etc. 

    For advocacy contribution, a reasonable attempt to contact the author will be made within the platform where they are advocating. For example, a DM in Twitter. 

    For discussion contributions, a message will be sent to the contributor in the discussion platform, for example a Slack DM or a GitHub Discussion tagging the author. 

    Once contact has been made, the team will continue to collect information needed for fulfilment. 

    Accepting the award, either explicitly or implicitly by responding to or cooperating with the program‚Äôs team, declares the winner‚Äôs approval to be featured in Aqua Security promotional campaigns and social media accounts.
