## Aqua Open Source

#### Our main projects

[**Trivy**](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy) (tri pronounced like trigger, vy pronounced like envy) is a comprehensive security scanner. It is reliable, fast, extremely easy to use, and it works wherever you need it.

[**Tracee**](https://github.com/aquasecurity/tracee) is a Runtime Security and forensics tool for Linux. It uses Linux eBPF technology to trace your system and applications at runtime, and analyzes collected events in order to detect suspicious behavioral patterns. It is usually delivered as a docker container, but there are other ways you can use it (even create your own customized tracee container).

#### **How you can get involved**

There are multiple way to get involed. The [Trivy documentation](https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy/latest/community/contribute/pr/) describes how to create your first PR and our repositories include [`good first issue`](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy/labels/good%20first%20issue).
Additionally, we love content contributions, such as blog posts on your channel.
